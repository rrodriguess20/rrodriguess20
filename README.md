- Hello, I’m @rrodriguess20

- I’m interested in:
  - Developing;
  - UX/UI
  - Linux & Open Source;
  - Technology & Science;
  - A cup of coffee;
 
 I want to make technology more accessible to all people,
specially for **kids** (who need to use technology</br>
to develop their skills, but without getting addicted to it)
and for **elder people**</br> (a group who needs technology to communicate with the world and their family, but sometimes</br>
can't followup all the new features that are released).

I want to make the world a better place.<br>
And I believe that techonology can be an way to achieve this dream!

Thanks for reading!

Att,
Rebeca Rodrigues.
