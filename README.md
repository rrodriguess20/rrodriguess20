My name is Rebeca Rodrigues. I'm majoring in Computer Science in the Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Ceará (IFCE)
I'll be sharing my projects here on GitHub.

- I’m interested in:
  - Web Developing;
  - UX/UI
  - Linux & Open Source;
  - A cup of tea;

Basically, I want to seek for knowledge and be a key of change in this world. Therefore, I want to start making the change by myself, through technology and science.
That's who I am.
